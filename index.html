    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="aboutme.jpg" alt="Viraj facilitating a community science workshop" class="section-photo">
        <p>
            Community, Connection, and Communication are the core of all of my endeavours.
            Science becomes meaningful when it is shared, questioned, and experienced together. 
            My work focuses on building spaces where people can encounter science with
            curiosity rather than intimidation.
            Through workshops, public events, and creative outreach, I collaborate with communities,
            educators, and institutions to make science and arts outreach and education accessible, 
            relational, and rooted in place.
        </p>

        <h2>Teaching & Learning Design</h2>
        <p>
            Teaching remains the foundation of my science communication practice.
            From 2013 to 2019, I taught introductory biology courses as a Primary Instructor
            and Teaching Assistant at Iowa State University.
            Teaching in a new country significantly shaped how I communicate science
            clearly, empathetically, and without assumptions about prior knowledge.
            In many ways, my students taught me a lot and for that I will always be grateful.
            I continued teaching after moving to Canada, through invited guest lectures
            in bioinformatics, biology, and parasitology.
        </p>
        <p>
            I received the Teaching Excellence Award in 2015 for inclusive pedagogy and effective
            explanation of complex biological concepts.
        </p>

    <!-- CSA -->
    <section>
        <h2>Creative Science Alliance</h2>
        <p>
            I founded the Creative Science Alliance (CSA) to design hands-on, Calgary-based STEAM
            outreach rooted in local ecology and community contexts.
            My goal is to create a community of local scientists, artists, communicators,
            and change-makers to make science and arts education and outreach accessible
            and engaging in Calgary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arts and Science are two sides of the same coin and neither can be learnt or experienced
            in isolation.
            Through CSA, I want to help Calgarians connect with the city by focusing not only on
            observing and learning about our environment, but also on how this learning feels.
            We may not remember what we learned in second grade, but we most likely remember how that
            experience made us feel - and these feelings are a significant reason that made us who 
            we are.
            At CSA, we encourage participants to focus equally on learning and feeling.

        <h2>Editorial & Newsletter Leadership</h2>
        <p>
            I am passionate about designing newsletters and websites.
            As the Departmental Newsletter Coordinator at Iowa State University,
            I maintained the "2-1-1" newsletter to connect lecture and lab sections
            and improve the overall student experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I founded and maintained a monthly newsletter called "Diversity Digest",
            which shared stories of biodiversity to increase student engagement.
            Students regularly contributed articles to the newsletter.
            While I started this newsletter for my sections, this newsletter was later shared across 
            all sections in the course.
